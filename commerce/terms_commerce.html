        b. <span class="highlight">Platform Commission:</span> The Platform deducts a fixed commission rate of <span class="highlight">10%</span> from the product's base price, excluding shipping fees.<br>
        c. <span class="highlight">Shipping Cost Handling:</span> Shipping fees are determined separately by the Seller and paid by the Buyer in Pi. The Seller acknowledges full responsibility for converting this Pi amount to cover the actual fiat shipping costs paid to the carrier. <span class="highlight">No commission is charged on the shipping fee component.</span>
    </p>

    <h2>2. Payment Guarantee and Escrow Period</h2>
    <p>
        a. <span class="highlight">Escrow Period:</span> The full transaction value (Product Price + Shipping Fee) is held in the Platform's Escrow system for a default period of <span class="highlight">14 days</span> from the Seller's confirmed shipping date.<br>
        b. <span class="highlight">Payment Release:</span> Funds are released to the Seller only upon:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;i. Expiration of the 14-day escrow period without any dispute filed by the Buyer.<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ii. Explicit confirmation of satisfactory receipt by the Buyer (release occurs within 48 hours of confirmation).
    </p>

    <h2>3. Shipping and Delivery Obligations</h2>
    <p>
        a. <span class="highlight">Seller’s Obligation:</span> The Seller must provide valid shipping proof and tracking information within <span class="highlight">72 hours</span> of receiving payment confirmation.<br>
        b. <span class="highlight">Shipping Risks:</span> The Platform is not responsible for delays, damage, or loss caused by the third-party shipping carrier, but will mediate disputes related to non-delivery.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Returns and Refunds</h2>
    <p>
        a. <span class="highlight">Right of Return:</span> The Buyer may request a return and full refund within <span class="highlight">7 days</span> of the confirmed delivery date if the product is damaged, materially different from the listing description, or incorrect.<br>
        b. <span class="highlight">Refund Amount:</span> If the return is approved, the Buyer receives a refund of the <span class="highlight">full Pi amount paid</span> (product price + original shipping fee).<br>
        c. <span class="highlight">Return Shipping Cost:</span> The Buyer generally bears the cost of return shipping, unless the item was proven defective or misrepresented by the Seller.
    </p>

    <h1>Privacy Policy for Commerce.pi (Physical Goods Marketplace)</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

    <p>We are committed to protecting the data of our Pioneers. This policy details how Commerce.pi handles personal information, especially concerning physical product transactions.</p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>
        In addition to the standard Pi Identity Data (Username, Account ID), we collect the following mandatory information for physical goods transactions:
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Shipping and Delivery Data:</span> Full legal name, complete shipping address (street, city, country, postal code), and primary contact number. This is essential for successful delivery.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Transaction Records:</span> Details of purchases, product specifications, and fulfillment status for escrow and dispute resolution.</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Communication Data:</span> Records of direct messages exchanged between the Buyer and Seller on the platform, used solely for resolving disputes.</li>
        </ul>
        <span class="highlight">Reminder:</span> We absolutely <span class="highlight">DO NOT</span> store or access your Pi Wallet Private Key.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Sharing of Information</h2>
    <p>Your privacy is paramount, but sharing certain data is necessary for logistics:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Sharing with the Counterparty:</span> When a sale is made, the Buyer's full shipping details (Name, Address, Contact Number) are shared with the Seller to enable shipping and order fulfillment.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Logistics Partners:</span> Shipping details are shared with third-party logistics companies (e.g., DHL, FedEx) responsible for delivering the product.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Legal and Pi Network Compliance:</span> We may share data if required by law or to comply with the Pi Network's terms and security protocols.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Security and Retention</h2>
    <p>
        We employ industry-standard security measures to protect the physical address and contact details you provide. Shipping data is retained for a maximum of 18 months post-delivery to facilitate any necessary warranty or fraud investigations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>
        As a user, you have the right to request access to the data we hold about you and to request correction of any inaccurate personal information.
    </p>
